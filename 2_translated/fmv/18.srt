1
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:07,900
The sky is beautiful...

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:11,920
Everything's over, isn't it?

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:12,920
Yeah...

4
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,620
I guess everything turned
out okay in the end?

5
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,500
I am of the same mind.

6
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,860
No, not just me, but everyone
else as well.

7
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,120
Thank you.

8
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:29,820
Your Majesty!

9
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,760
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!!

10
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:41,720
I always knew...what would happen
to this world because of me...

11
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,800
And yet... No matter what, I desired
the body of a Huma...

12
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,860
Why... Why was that?

13
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:54,540
But...I've finally come to realize
what is really important...

14
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,660
At least...as the ruler of this kingdom...

15
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:00,860
I was able to do this one thing...
for the sake of <Yellow>Mankind<White>.

16
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,800
Please, hang in there!

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm sorry...for having caused
trouble until the end...

18
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:09,720
I leave this nation...in your hands...

19
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,560
How could I rule without you?!

20
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,360
So long as you're there, it will be fine....

21
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,040
No...

22
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:19,160
Please live...

23
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,620
For my sake...

24
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:23,420
Agarte...

25
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:25,540
Milhaust...

26
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,680
I've always...loved you...

27
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,860
Agarte...

28
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,300
The conflicts between the races are still ongoing.

29
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:42,340
This hatred and sorrow isn't going to
disappear any time soon.

30
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:46,420
But, we need to be able to overcome that...

31
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,560
So that this nation...can experience a <Cyan>rebirth<White>.

32
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,520
<Yellow>Mankind<White> will have to build relationships anew.

33
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,700
It will likely take time, but it can be done.

34
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,340
Yes, I agree.

35
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:06,000
A time will come where everyone will
see eye to eye. Just like we have.

36
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,360
We are all one <Yellow>Mankind<White>.

37
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:13,300
When everyone's hearts came together
as one during that disaster,

38
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,480
I'm sure everyone all over the world realized that.

39
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,960
A nation <Cyan>reborn<White>...

40
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,780
I wonder what it'll be like.

41
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:34,240
At the very least, I'd like to imagine it's
a world where I don't have to wear this anymore.

42
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,520
Are you willing to lend me a hand?

43
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,780
We might have different ways of getting there,

44
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:53,220
but we all have the same goal, right?

45
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,500
<Yellow>Mankind<White> will follow whatever path you choose.

46
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,360
I feel like we can help guide
them along the way.

47
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:07,320
I know we can do it.
